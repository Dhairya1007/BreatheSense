# BreatheSense
The source code and the Android App for my BreatheSense Project. BreatheSense is a breathe to Speech assistive device which is designed for people with disabilities of speaking or listening, allowing them to engage in casual conversation with normal people. 

Instructions:

1. Walabot is a 3D imaging sensors which uses RF sensors to perform various operations like BreatheSensing, Object detection, in wall imaging and a lot more. For more information, follow this link : https://walabot.com/makers 

We are using the Walabot Creator model for this particular project.

2. I have provided some extra python codes which I used to understand the functionality of MQTT, Walabot's Breathe Sensing Capabilites. But if you just want to get into the fun part of testing the project, just take the final code named : "BreatheSense_Windows". 

3. The project can be used with a Raspberry Pi too, but you need a very strong and stable power supply for the pi, which should be more then 2.5 Amperes atleast, as Walabot consumes a lot of power. I didn't have a power supply of that rating with me as I created this project while I was at a Hackathon, but feel free to test the same on a Pi.

4. The Android App provided with it is pretty easy to understand. It is a 2 page app with one page showing the Sensor Readings and the second page showing the output speech with an option to read it out loud.
